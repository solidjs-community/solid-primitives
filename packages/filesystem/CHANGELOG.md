### Patch Changes

- 3fad3789: Revert from publishing separate server, development, and production builds that has to rely on export conditions
  to publishing a single build that can be used in any environment.
  Envs will be checked at with `isDev`and `isServer` consts exported by `"solid-js/web"` so it's still tree-shakeable.
