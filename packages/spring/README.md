A small SolidJS hook to interpolate signal changes with spring physics. Inspired by & directly forked from [`svelte-motion/spring`](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte-motion#spring) as such, has a very familiar API design.

With this primitive, you can easily animate values that can be interpolated like `number`, `date`, and collections (arrays or nested objects) of those datatypes.

`createSpring` - Provides a getter and setter for the spring primitive.

The following options are available:

- `stiffness` (number, default `0.15`) — a value between 0 and 1 where higher means a 'tighter' spring
- `damping` (number, default `0.8`) — a value between 0 and 1 where lower means a 'springier' spring
- `precision` (number, default `0.01`) — determines the threshold at which the spring is considered to have 'settled', where lower means more precise

## Installation

```bash
npm install @solid-primitives/spring
# or
yarn add @solid-primitives/spring
# or
pnpm add @solid-primitives/spring
```

## How to use it

```ts
// Basic Example
const [progress, setProgress] = createSpring(0);

// Example with options (less sudden movement)
const [radialProgress, setRadialProgress] = createSpring(0, { stiffness: 0.05 });

// Example with collections (e.g. Object or Array).
const [xy, setXY] = createSpring(
  { x: 50, y: 50 },
  { stiffness: 0.08, damping: 0.2, precision: 0.01 },
);
```
