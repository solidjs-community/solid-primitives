# @solid-primitives/list

## 1.0.0-next.3

### Patch Changes

- 638c530: Bump the `solid-js`/`@solidjs/web`/`@solidjs/signals` peer and dev dependency range to `2.0.0-rc.9`, and `babel-preset-solid` to `2.0.0-rc.2`.

  Two behavior fixes were needed to keep up with upstream changes in this range:

  - `@solid-primitives/deep`: `captureStoreUpdates` no longer missed property changes. As of `2.0.0-rc.1` a store's `[$TRACK]` only fires for structural changes (key additions/removals), so leaf value changes stopped being reported. Each node's direct property values are now tracked individually. Updates are still reported at the shallowest node that actually changed.
  - `@solid-primitives/storage`: `makePersisted` no longer persists stale data. Signal writes stay pending until the next flush in `2.0.0-rc.1`+, so reading the value back inside the setter returned the _previous_ one — persisting stale data, or removing the stored entry entirely when the previous value was nullish. The value returned by the setter is now persisted directly.

## 1.0.0-next.2

### Patch Changes

- Bump the `solid-js`/`@solidjs/web`/`@solidjs/signals`/`babel-preset-solid` peer and dev dependency range to `2.0.0-rc.0`. No API or behavior changes on our end — this tracks upstream's move from the beta series into the release candidate.
- Updated dependencies
  - @solid-primitives/utils@7.0.0-next.4

## 1.0.0-next.1

### Patch Changes

- 50e36c9: Bump the `solid-js`/`@solidjs/web` peer and dev dependency range to `2.0.0-beta.20`. No API or behavior changes; beta.19/beta.20 introduced no breaking changes upstream (internal tree-shaking work, a new `solid-js/refresh` HMR entry point, and SSR/hydration/`lazy()` bug fixes).
