Primitives to query and watch geolocation information from within the browser.

## Installation

```
npm install @solid-primitives/geolocation
# or
yarn add @solid-primitives/geolocation
```

## How to use it

### createGeolocation

Used to fetch current geolocation data as a resource. This primitive uses `createResource` to return a location, so `loading`, `error`

```ts
const [location, refetch] = createGeolocation();
```

or with options:

```ts
const [location, refetch] = createGeolocation({
  enableHighAccuracy: false,
  maximumAge: 0,
  timeout: 200
});
```

#### Definition

```ts
createGeolocation(
  options: MaybeAccessor<PositionOptions> // these override basic defaults (see Types section)
): [
  location: Resource<GeolocationCoordinates | undefined>,
  refetch: Accessor<void>
]
```

### createGeolocationWatcher

Creates a geolocation watcher and updates a signal with the latest coordinates. This primitive returns two reactive getters: `location` and `error`.

```ts
const watcher = createGeolocationWatcher(true);
console.log(watcher.location);
console.log(watcher.error);
```

#### Definition

```ts
createGeolocationWatcher(
  enabled: MaybeAccessor<boolean>,
  options: MaybeAccessor<PositionOptions>
): {
  location: GeolocationCoordinates | null,
  error: GeolocationPositionError | null
}
```

#### Types

The values returned in the location property are as follows:

```ts
interface GeolocationCoordinates {
  readonly accuracy: number;
  readonly altitude: number | null;
  readonly altitudeAccuracy: number | null;
  readonly heading: number | null;
  readonly latitude: number;
  readonly longitude: number;
  readonly speed: number | null;
}
```

The options property defaults to the following value unless overwritten:

```ts
const geolocationDefaults: PositionOptions = {
  enableHighAccuracy: false,
  maximumAge: 0,
  timeout: Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY
};
```

## Primitive Ideas

We're always looking to enhance our primitives. Some ideas:

- `createDistance` (supply a lat/lng and reactively calculate the difference in km/m)
- `createWithinRadius` (a signal for tracking if a user is within a radius boundary)
