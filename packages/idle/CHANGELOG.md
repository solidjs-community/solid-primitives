## 0.2.3

### Patch Changes

- 62e331d: Fix named imports breaking under Rolldown (Vite 8+ / Storybook 10.4.6+) bundlers.

  These packages re-export their public API via `export * from "./x.js"` barrels. Rollup resolves named imports through these at link time, but Rolldown's static analysis doesn't reliably follow `export *` for named-export resolution, causing errors like:

  ```
  "createEventListener" is not exported by "@solid-primitives/event-listener/dist/index.js"
  ```

  The build now also emits explicit `export { name } from "./x.js"` lines for every runtime export reachable through a barrel's `export *`, derived automatically from each submodule's compiled output — so `dist/` is bundler-agnostic regardless of how a given tool resolves star re-exports.

## 0.0.105

### Patch Changes

- 3fad3789: Revert from publishing separate server, development, and production builds that has to rely on export conditions
  to publishing a single build that can be used in any environment.
  Envs will be checked at with `isDev`and `isServer` consts exported by `"solid-js/web"` so it's still tree-shakeable.
