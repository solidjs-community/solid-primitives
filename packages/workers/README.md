A set of utility to support using Web Workers and Shared Workers:

`createWorker` - Provides a getter and setter for the primitive.

`createWorkerPool` - Creates a pool of workers and round-robins requests between each.

`createSignaledWorker` - Creates a work with that reads and writes to signals.

## How to use it

### createWorker

Create a basic web worker:

```ts
const [worker, start, stop] = createWorker(function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
});
console.log(await worker.add(1, 2));
// output: 3
```

### createWorkerPool

Create a worker pool with a set concurrency:

```ts
const [pool, start, stop] = createWorkerPool(4, function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
});
console.log(await pool.add(1, 2));
// output: 3
```

### createSignaledWorker

Create a more advanced worker that accepts multiple instructional inputs:

```ts
const [input, setInput] = createSignal([1, 1]);
const [output, setOutput] = createSignal([1, 1]);
createSignaledWorker({
  input,
  output: setOutput,
  func: function add([a, b]) {
    return a + b;
  }
});
setInput([1, 2]);
console.log(output());
// output: 3
```
