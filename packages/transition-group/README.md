Provides reactive primitives for implementing transition effects on a group of elements, or your own `<Transition>` and `<TransitionGroup>` components.

- [`createSwitchTransition`](#createSwitchTransition) - Create an element transition interface for switching between single elements.
- [`createListTransition`](#createListTransition) - Create an element list transition interface for changes to the list of elements.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @solid-primitives/transition-group
# or
yarn add @solid-primitives/transition-group
# or
pnpm add @solid-primitives/transition-group
```

## `createSwitchTransition`

Create an element transition interface for switching between single elements.
It can be used to implement own transition effect, or a custom `<Transition>`-like component.

### How to use it

It will observe the source and return a signal with array of elements to be rendered (current one and exiting ones).

`createSwitchTransition` takes two parameters:

- `source` a signal with the current element. Any nullish value will mean there is no element.
  Any object can used as the source, but most likely you will want to use a `HTMLElement` or `SVGElement`.

- `options` transition options:

  - `onEnter` - a function to be called when a new element is entering. It receives the element and a callback to be called when the transition is done.

  - `onExit` - a function to be called when an exiting element is leaving. It receives the element and a callback to be called when the transition is done.

  - `mode` - transition mode. Defaults to `"parallel"`. Other options are `"out-in"` and `"in-out"`.

  - `appear` - whether to run the transition on the initial element. Defaults to `false`.

    If enabled, the initial element will still be included in the initial render (for SSR), but the transition fill happen when the first client-side effect is run. So to avoid the initial element to be visible, you can set the initial element's style to `display: none` and set it to `display: block` in the `onEnter` callback.

Returns a signal with an array of the current element and exiting previous elements.

```ts
import { createSwitchTransition } from "@solid-primitives/transition-group";

const [el, setEl] = createSignal<HTMLDivElement>();

const rendered = createSwitchTransition(el, {
  onEnter(el, done) {
    // the enter callback is called before the element is inserted into the DOM
    // so run the animation in the next animation frame / microtask
    queueMicrotask(() => {
      /*...*/
    });
  },
  onExit(el, done) {
    // the exitting element is kept in the DOM until the done() callback is called
  },
});

// change the source to trigger the transition
setEl(refToHtmlElement);
```

### Resolving JSX

Usually the source will be a JSX element, and you will want to resolve it to a DOM element before passing it to `createSwitchTransition`. It leaves the resolving to you, so you can do it in any way you want.

For example, you can `children` helper from `solid-js`, to get the first found HTML element.

```ts
import { children } from "solid-js";
import { createSwitchTransition } from "@solid-primitives/transition-group";

const resolved = children(() => props.children);
const filtered = createMemo(() => resolved.toArray().find(el => el instanceof HTMLElement));
return createSwitchTransition(filtered, {
  /*...*/
});
```

Or use a `resolveFirst` helper from `@solid-primitives/refs`

```ts
import { resolveFirst } from "@solid-primitives/refs";
import { createSwitchTransition } from "@solid-primitives/transition-group";

const resolved = resolveFirst(() => props.children);
return createSwitchTransition(resolved, {
  /*...*/
});
```

## `createListTransition`

Create an element list transition interface for changes to the list of elements.
It can be used to implement own transition effect, or a custom `<TransitionGroup>`-like component.

### How to use it

It will observe the source and return a signal with array of elements to be rendered (current ones and exiting ones).

`createListTransition` takes two parameters:

- `source` a signal with the current list of elements.
  Any object can used as the element, but most likely you will want to use a `HTMLElement` or `SVGElement`.

- `options` transition options:

  - `onChange` - a function to be called when the list changes. It receives the list of added elements, removed elements, and moved elements. It also receives a callback to be called when the removed elements are finished animating (they can be removed from the DOM).

  - `appear` - whether to run the transition on the initial elements. Defaults to `false`.

  If enabled, the initial elements will still be included in the initial render (for SSR), but the transition fill happen when the first client-side effect is run. So to avoid the initial elements to be visible, you can set the initial element's style to `display: none` and set it to `display: block` in the `onChange` callback.

  - `exitMethod` - This controls how the elements exit.

    - `"remove"` removes the element immediately.
    - `"move-to-end"` (default) will move elements which have exited to the end of the array.
    - `"keep-index"` will splice them in at their previous index.

Returns a signal with an array of the current elements and exiting previous elements.

```ts
import { createListTransition } from "@solid-primitives/transition-group";

const [els, setEls] = createSignal<HTMLElement[]>([]);

const rendered = createListTransition(els, {
  onChange({ list, added, removed, unchanged, finishRemoved }) {
    // the callback is called before the added elements are inserted into the DOM
    // so run the animation in the next animation frame / microtask
    queueMicrotask(() => {
      /*...*/
    });

    // the removed elements are kept in the DOM until the finishRemoved() callback is called
    finishRemoved(removed);
  },
});

// change the source to trigger the transition
setEls([...refsToHTMLElements]);
```

### Resolving JSX

Usually the source will be a JSX Element, and you will want to resolve it to a list of DOM elements before passing it to `createListTransition`. It leaves the resolving to you, so you can do it in any way you want.

For example, you can `children` helper from `solid-js`, and filter out non-HTML elements:

```ts
import { children } from "solid-js";
import { createListTransition } from "@solid-primitives/transition-group";

const resolved = children(() => props.children);
const filtered = createMemo(() => resolved.toArray().filter(el => el instanceof HTMLElement));
return createListTransition(filtered, {
  /*...*/
});
```

Or use a `resolveElements` helper from `@solid-primitives/refs`

```ts
import { resolveElements } from "@solid-primitives/refs";
import { createSwitchTransition } from "@solid-primitives/transition-group";

const resolved = resolveElements(() => props.children);
return createListTransition(resolved.toArray, {
  /*...*/
});
```
