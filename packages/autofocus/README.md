Primitives for autofocusing HTML elements.

The native autofocus attribute only works on page load, which makes it incompatible with SolidJS. These primitives run on render, allowing autofocus on initial render as well as dynamically added components.

- [`autofocus`](#autofocus) - Directive to autofocus an element on render.
- [`createAutofocus`](#createAutofocus) - Reactive primitive to autofocus an element on render.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @solid-primitives/autofocus
# or
yarn add @solid-primitives/autofocus
# or
pnpm add @solid-primitives/autofocus
```

## `autofocus`

### How to use it

The `autofocus` directive uses the native `autofocus` attribute to determine it should focus the element or not.
Using this directive without `autofocus={true}` (or the shorthand `autofocus`) will not perform anything.

As a directive:

```tsx
import { autofocus } from "@solid-primitives/autofocus";
// prevents from being tree-shaken by TS
autofocus

<button use:autofocus autofocus>
  Autofocused
</button>;

// Autofocus directive can be disabled if `false` is passed as option
<button use:autofocus={false} autofocus>
  Not Autofocused
</button>;
```

Or with `ref`

```tsx
import { autofocus } from "@solid-primitives/autofocus";

<button ref={autofocus} autofocus>
  Autofocused
</button>;
```

### `createAutofocus`

`createAutofocus` reactively autofocuses an element passid in as a signal.

```tsx
import { createAutofocus } from "@solid-primitives/autofocus";

// Using ref
let ref!: HTMLButtonElement;
createAutofocus(() => ref);

<button ref={ref}>Autofocused</button>;

// Using ref signal
const [ref, setRef] = createSignal<HTMLButtonElement>();
createAutofocus(ref);

<button ref={setRef}>Autofocused</button>;
```
