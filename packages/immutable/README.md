Primitive for rectifying immutable values and dealing with immutability in Solid.

- [`createImmutable`](#createImmutable) - Creates a store derived from the given immutable source.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @solid-primitives/immutable
# or
yarn add @solid-primitives/immutable
# or
pnpm add @solid-primitives/immutable
```

## `createImmutable`

Creates a store _(deeply nested reactive object)_ derived from the given immutable source. The source can be any signal that is updated in an immutable fashion.

It's an **experimental** primitive, a proof of concept of derived nested reactivity. It's not meant to be used in production, but rather as a playground for experimenting with new ideas.

### How to use it

`createImmutable` is a function that takes a reactive function as the first param, and an optional configuration object as the second param:

- `source` reactive function returning an immutable object
- `options` optional configuration
  - `key` property name to use as unique identifier for objects when their reference changes
  - `merge` controls how objects witohut a unique identifier are identified when reconciling an array. If `true` the index is used, otherwise the object reference itself is used.

```ts
import { createImmutable } from "@solid-primitives/immutable";

// source - can be any reactive function returning an immutable object
const [data, setData] = createSignal({ a: 1, b: 2 });

// reactive state derived from the source
const state = createImmutable(data);

// just like in Solid stores, the updates are fine-grained - only the changed values are updated
createEffect(() => console.log(state.a, state.b));
// logs 1 2

setData({ a: 2, b: 3 });
// logs 2 3
```

### Usage with immutable state management libraries

There are many state management libraries that provide immutable data structures, such as [Immer](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/), [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/), [XState](https://xstate.js.org/docs/), etc.

`createImmutable` can help you turn them into reactive objects, only updating the changed values.

> **Warning** `createStore` with `reconcile` will give you the similar result, while being more efficient.

```tsx
import { createSlice, configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import { createImmutable } from "@solid-primitives/immutable";

const slice = createSlice({
  initialState: [
    { id: 1, title: "Learn Solid", completed: false },
    { id: 2, title: "Learn Redux", completed: false },
  ],
  reducers: {
    /* ... (immutable actions) */
  },
});

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: slice.reducer,
});

const [source, setSource] = createSignal(store.getState());
store.subscribe(() => setSource(store.getState()));

const todos = createImmutable(source);

// the references of todos will be preserved, even though they were destructured in the store
<For each={todos}>
  {todo => (
    <div>
      <input
        type="checkbox"
        checked={todo.completed}
        onClick={() => store.dispatch(slice.actions.toggleTodo(todo.id))}
      />
      {todo.title}
    </div>
  )}
</For>;
```

### Usage with `createResource`

Data fetched from the server is immutable, so `createImmutable` can help you turn it into a reactive object, only updating the changed values.

> **Warning** `createResource` provides an experimental `storage` option that can be used together with `createStore` and `reconcile` to achieve the similar result, while being more efficient
> https://www.solidjs.com/docs/latest/api#createresource

```ts
import { createResource } from "solid-js";
import { createImmutable } from "@solid-primitives/immutable";

const [data, { refetch }] = createResource(() =>
  fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1").then(res => res.json()),
);

const state = createImmutable(data);

createEffect(() => console.log(state.title, state.completed));

// newely fetched data will be merged with the previous state
refetch();
```
