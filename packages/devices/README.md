Creates a primitive to get a list of media devices (microphones, speakers, cameras). There are filtered primitives for convenience reasons.

## Installation

```
npm install @solid-primitives/devices
# or
yarn add @solid-primitives/devices
```

## How to use it

### Media Devices

```ts
const devices = createDevices();

const microphones = createMicrophones();
const speakers = createSpeakers();
const cameras = createCameras();
```

The filtered primitives are build so that they only triggered if the devices of their own kind changed.

### Device Motion

```ts
const accelerometer = createAccelerometer();
const gyroscope = createGyroscope();
```

## Demo
