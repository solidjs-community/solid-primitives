/**
 * Real server-render → client-hydrate round trip, for catching hydration hazards that
 * per-package `test/server.test.ts` files structurally cannot: those run under this
 * monorepo's `@solid-primitives/source` resolve condition, so every `@solid-primitives/*`
 * import resolves to workspace `src` instead of the published `dist` build a real consumer
 * gets from node_modules.
 *
 * The SERVER half genuinely closes that gap: it's rendered in a real `node` subprocess with no
 * special resolve conditions, so `@solid-primitives/*` and `@solidjs/web` resolve exactly as
 * they would for a real npm consumer (dist builds, the real "node" export condition).
 *
 * The CLIENT half does not close it the same way. `hydrate()` runs back in the calling Vitest
 * worker, so the dom-compiled fixture's own `@solid-primitives/*` imports still resolve through
 * Vite's module graph — this project's `@solid-primitives/source` condition is active there,
 * i.e. workspace `src`, not `dist` (confirmed empirically: a marker export added only to a
 * package's `src` was visible from inside the dynamically-imported dom module). For packages
 * with no JSX of their own — the common case for `create*` primitives — this doesn't affect the
 * property under test: Solid's owner-id allocation lives entirely in `@solidjs/signals`'s
 * runtime and doesn't depend on whether the *calling* code was pre-compiled. It would matter for
 * a package whose own public surface includes JSX.
 *
 * ⚠️ Because the server half resolves `dist` and the client half resolves `src`, a **stale**
 * `dist` build (edited `src` without rebuilding) makes the two halves run genuinely different
 * code — e.g. one side still has an old `createMemo` the other doesn't — which desyncs owner-id
 * allocation for real and surfaces as a false-positive "unclaimed server-rendered node" warning
 * that has nothing to do with the hazard under test. Rebuild (`pnpm -w build`, or scoped to the
 * touched packages) after editing a package's `src` and before trusting a hydration test result.
 *
 * See the hope-ui solid-primitives-eval.md "transform-boundary hydration hazard": a
 * render-body `createSignal(fn)`/`createMemo(fn)` living in an un-transformed dependency was
 * reported to desync hydration ids between server and client. Whether that's a general
 * solid-js limitation or specific to a non-standard SSR harness, this test proves (or
 * disproves) it for each package using the real, standard `@solidjs/web` renderToString +
 * hydrate pipeline — no custom harness of our own to second-guess.
